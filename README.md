### Hey, I'm Matt ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer working primarily with JavaScript and Python. I'm passionate about building secure, scalable, and efficient applications for the web. I'm constantly growing in my abilities as a programmer. While working full-time, I'm completing a computer science degree through Oregon State University and finishing a coding bootcamp through the Springboard Software Engineering Career Track.

My current side projects involve building scalable web applications using Node.js and React. I'm also building things with Flask, as well as experimenting with C.
