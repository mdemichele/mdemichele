### Hey, I'm Matt ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer at OpenTech Alliance working primarily with JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and C#. I'm interested in building secure, scalable, and efficient applications for the web.

My current side projects involve building web applications using Node.js and React. I'm also building things with Flask, as well as experimenting with C.
