### Hey, I'm Matt ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer I at Starbucks working primarily with JavaScript and Python. I'm interested in building secure, scalable, and efficient applications for the web. I'm constantly growing in my abilities as a programmer. 

My current side projects involve building scalable web applications using Node.js and React. I'm also building things with Flask, as well as experimenting with C.
